# DSUA-301-Final Project-Moodify
A real-time emotion detection and music recommendation system.
We trained emotion detection models on the FER2013 dataset with finetuned  CNN, VGG16, ResNet and paired them with a music recommendation model based on CNN and RNN-attention architectures.
The system can predict emotions like angry, sad, happy, surprise, and fear, then recommend 10 songs tailored to the detected emotion.
